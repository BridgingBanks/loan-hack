Bob owns a car dealership in Framingham, Massachusetts, Bob's Acme of Framingham. Bob sells new cars manufactured by Acme as well as used cars acquired from buyer trade-ins and auction. 

Alice needs a new car. She currently owns free and clear of liens a 1999 Jalopy 2000. She wants a 2016 Acme Flash and has test driven them at several dealers. Alice visited Bob's website and found a large inventory Acme Flashes that she liked. 

Alice completed a credit applicaton through Bob's website. She received an email response shortly thereafter notifying that she had been approved for financing a Flash for up to 72 months at an intereest rate of 5.5% from one of the dealer's financing sources, a regional credit union, Charlie's Credit Union. 

[Looking for a way to bring blockchain into this beyond just vaulting/storage, which is a small, but important step? Possibly the prom note is part of a blockchain-based payment system that sends notices to transfer to her checking account. Charlie offers an incentive to open a credit union checking account. In order to reduce her rate to 5.5%, Alice opens a checking account from which her payment is direct debited by Charlie]

Alice drove her Jalopy to Bob's to buy a Flash. Bob's salesperson took her on a test drive of two Flashes.  While she was test driving, Bob's technicians evaluated the Jalopy for trade-in, giving it a value of $2,900.

Alice chose a 4-cylinder red Flash with a price of $32,000. She negotiated a price of $31,000, plus credit for her trade-in. 

Bob presented Alice with a Retail Installment Contract for the purchase of the vehicle. The deal included the following terms: Purchase price, trade value, interest rate, 72 payment of $459.09 commencing on February 1, 2016.

Alice signed the contract electronically. Billy printed and gave her a paper copy of the deal. [Dazza - do we want the dealer Bob to directly deploy to blockchain, or do we want Charlie to do it once they receive the document?]

Alice drove the car and made her first 3 payments in February, March and April. [Alice closed her checking account with Charlie]. She made no more payments after April, 2016. Charlie sent her letters regarding late payments in May and June. 

[Dazza - do we want Charlie to have to recover the vehicle judicially or do we want a simple enforceable chargeoff? I am assuming the latter, but either will work - For lawyers I would add in the replevin, but for developers I think simple chargeoff enforceability is enough.]

In July, Charlie's collection agent reached Alice by phone. She said "I changed my mind," and hung up. The next time Charlie tried to call Alice, her number was disconnected. Charlie referred Alice's account to a repossession agent, Dale's Towing and Recovery service. Dale repossessed the vehicle peaceably at Alice's workplace on August 1, 2016. 

On August 1, 2016, Charlie accelerated the balance due on the loan, for a total of $31,617.62. Charlie sent a notice of repossession and right to redeem the vehicle upon payment of the accelerated balance. Alice did not respond.

The vehicle was sold at a large wholesale auction on September 15, 2016, for $22,550, and the proceeds, minus $250 auction costs, remitted to Charlie. Repossession fees were $300.

Charlie sent a letter to Alice demanding payment the outstanding balance of $9,167.62.   Alice did not respond to the letter.
