Secured loan originations, while complex, create multiple opportunities to integrate blockchain goodness that scales to multiple verticals. 

TLDR:

Blockchain techology can enable integration of business, legal and technical aspects of transactions. To illustrate and prove this thesis, (Dazza and Nina) spent the week hacking a core legal element, the secured transaction.  In a secured transaction, collateral is pledged as security for a debt. The documentary elements of a secured transaction are typically general contract terms and conditions, a promissory note and a collateral security agreement,  These three elements serve different functions and are often, but not always, separate documents within a loan transaction. By iterating a methodical, modular implementation of secured loans, we can use blockchain technology to both replicate and advance legally significant commercial relationships.

We explored secured transactions in terms of a U.S consumer auto loan. 



Blockchain technology can record reliable evidence of a contract.



Topic Items: 

### Record Evidence on Blockchain of Enforceable Contract
* Like three paragraph explaining what this is and why it's important

### Integrate Key Aspects of Legal Auto Loan Agreements with Technical Capabilities
For example, lets take the auto lane...

* Promisory note (magic words "borrower promised to pay lender...")
* Collatoral security interesting (magic words "borrower grants security interest in collatoral...")

### Integrate Key Legal Processes with Technical Capabilities

* Perfecting interests (ownership and security)
* Continuing compliance (terms of contract and regulatory rules) 

### Support and Reflect Key Business Practices with Legal and Technical Integrations

* Continuing live connection with the underlying asset 
* Data science and applied analytics for achieving cost and risk reduction and new sources of value

### Computable Law as a Core Business Capability

* Value of embracing and integrating law through architecture and code
* Extrapolating from Smart Loans to data-driven, digital entity

In general the functional parts of a secured loan contract are: 

The integrated contract containing the complete terms and conditions of the loan. It is important to store this document in a way that preserves it for evidentiary purposes and that complies with laws for transferable records. 

Preservation is important because: 

Blockchain can improve this process because: 

The promissory note. A promissory note is an enforeable promise to pay money in the future. The promissory note is the consideration for the loan. In some loans, the promissory note is a separate document from the terms and conditions. In retail installment agreements, i.e., contracts used to finance purchases by consumers of items like automobiles, boats and other non-real property, the promissory note is typically included as part of the terms and conditions. In some contracts, including real property purchases, promissory notes are often separate documents.

Smart contracts can execute the logic of promissory notes, i.e. transfer payment or generate secure, automatic payment instructions. 

In addition, promissory notes in some circumstances can be severed from the other parts of a contract and transferred as value objects that are securitized and turned into financial investments/products.

Collateral Security Agreement. In order to lend money to finance a purchase, a creditor takes a "security interest" in the property that is pledged by the borrower as collateral. This means that in the event of default, for example for nonpayment, the creditor has the right to take possession of property and sell it to offset the borrower's debt under the contract. 

Blockchain smart contracts offer multiple options for managing collateral.
