Secured loan originations, while complex, create multiple opportunities to integrate blockchain goodness that scales to multiple verticals. 

In general the functional parts of a secured loan contract are: 

The integrated contract containing the complete terms and conditions of the loan. It is important to store this document in a way that preserves it for evidentiary purposes and that complies with laws for transferable records. 

Preservation is important because: 

Blockchain can improve this process because: 

The promissory note. A promissory note is an enforeable promise to pay money in the future. The promissory note is the consideration for the loan. In some loans, the promissory note is a separate document from the terms and conditions. In retail installment agreements, i.e., contracts used to finance purchases by consumers of items like automobiles, boats and other non-real property, the promissory note is typically included as part of the terms and conditions. In some contracts, including real property purchases, promissory notes are often separate documents.

Smart contracts can execute the logic of promissory notes, i.e. transfer payment or generate secure, automatic payment instructions. 

In addition, promissory notes in some circumstances can be severed from the other parts of a contract and transferred as value objects that are securitized and turned into financial investments/products.

Collateral Security Agreement. In order to lend money to finance a purchase, a creditor takes a "security interest" in the property that is pledged by the borrower as collateral. This means that in the event of default, for example for nonpayment, the creditor has the right to take possession of property and sell it to offset the borrower's debt under the contract. 

Blockchain smart contracts offer multiple options for managing collateral.
