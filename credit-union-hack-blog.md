Secured loan originations, while complex, create multiple opportunities to integrate blockchain goodness that scales to multiple verticals. 

TLDR:

Blockchain techology can enable integration of business, legal and technical aspects of transactions. To illustrate and prove this thesis, (Dazza and Nina) spent the week hacking a core legal element, the secured transaction.  In a secured transaction, collateral is pledged as security for a debt. The documentary elements of a secured transaction are typically general contract terms and conditions, a promissory note and a collateral security agreement,  These three elements serve different functions and are often, but not always, separate documents within a loan transaction. By iterating a methodical, modular implementation of secured loans, we can use blockchain technology to both replicate and advance legally significant commercial relationships.

We explored secured transactions in terms of a U.S consumer auto loan governed by the (Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 255B, Retail Instalment Sales of Motor Vehicles.)<https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartIII/TitleIV/Chapter255B>

### Record Evidence on Blockchain of Enforceable Contract
* Like three paragraph explaining what this is and why it's important

Blockchain technology can create and preserve reliable *evidence*, critical to providing bedrock element of contract law: enforceability.

Legal enforcement of a contract means obtaining the assistance of a court in order to force the parties to comply with the promises they made. This certainty of judicial enforcement provides the predictability of outcome necessary to make a loan, i.e. to engage in the risk-bearing behavior of spending money to day in exchange for increased returns tomorrow. The foundation of enforceability is evidence, that is, the rubric under which we decide that a fact is reliable enough to be considered by a court. 

Blockchain smart contracts meet this standard via cryptographically secure content-addressable storage. In a process called hashing, data is passed through complex equations to produce a unique identifier. The hashing process is one-way, meaning no two sets of data produce the same outcome, and it is infeasible to decipher the hash to reveal the contents without a key. The distributed ledger provides the requisite immutability and audit trail.This combination produces the unique record of provenance, authority and control required by existing law, exceeding the capabilities of prior technology.

Blockchain storage of enforceable contracts provides the chain of custody and authentication required in order to admit a record into evidence. This step alone meets several manifest business needs. The evidence-recording aspect of contracting is today best accomplished by *dual integration*, the combination of an enforceable, integrated electronic contract with blockchain storage. 

Blockchain storage gives a more accurate view on admissibility of a contract, a critical step for enforceabilty. Rather than simply rely on a human sworn statement to provide authentication, blockchain storage provides a timestamp, attribution and a record of all events related to the document. Dual integration allows us to save a contract in a way that meets parties' existing commercial needs while building solutions that take advantage of more complex smart contract functionality. 

Smart contracts protect integrity of account data for broader use in commerce. For example, transparent, traceable, transferrable assets support the ability to hypothecate and securitize existing contracts (assets) and to ensure cost-effective handling of nonperforming loans.


### Integrate Key Aspects of Legal Auto Loan Agreements with Technical Capabilities

To illustrate blockchain smart contract potential, we explored consumer automobile loan originations. An automobile loan is a secured loan, that is, a vehicle (collateral) is pledged as security for the borrower's promise to make payments. If the borrower fails to make payments, the creditor has the right to repossess and sell the vehicle to satisfy the loan.

An auto loan contains several elements that are amenable to smart contract logic: 
 - terms and conditions (stored on blockchain as evidence)
 - promissory note (value transfer)
 - security agreement (rights to collateral)

* Promisory note (magic words "borrower promised to pay lender...")
* Collatoral security interesting (magic words "borrower grants security interest in collatoral...")

### Integrate Key Legal Processes with Technical Capabilities

* Perfecting interests (ownership and security)
* Continuing compliance (terms of contract and regulatory rules) 

### Support and Reflect Key Business Practices with Legal and Technical Integrations

* Continuing live connection with the underlying asset 
* Data science and applied analytics for achieving cost and risk reduction and new sources of value

### Computable Law as a Core Business Capability

* Value of embracing and integrating law through architecture and code
* Extrapolating from Smart Loans to data-driven, digital entity

In general the functional parts of a secured loan contract are: 

The integrated contract containing the complete terms and conditions of the loan. It is important to store this document in a way that preserves it for evidentiary purposes and that complies with laws for transferable records. 

Preservation is important because: 

Blockchain can improve this process because: 

The promissory note. A promissory note is an enforeable promise to pay money in the future. The promissory note is the consideration for the loan. In some loans, the promissory note is a separate document from the terms and conditions. In retail installment agreements, i.e., contracts used to finance purchases by consumers of items like automobiles, boats and other non-real property, the promissory note is typically included as part of the terms and conditions. In some contracts, including real property purchases, promissory notes are often separate documents.

Smart contracts can execute the logic of promissory notes, i.e. transfer payment or generate secure, automatic payment instructions. 

In addition, promissory notes in some circumstances can be severed from the other parts of a contract and transferred as value objects that are securitized and turned into financial investments/products.

Collateral Security Agreement. In order to lend money to finance a purchase, a creditor takes a "security interest" in the property that is pledged by the borrower as collateral. This means that in the event of default, for example for nonpayment, the creditor has the right to take possession of property and sell it to offset the borrower's debt under the contract. 

Blockchain smart contracts offer multiple options for managing collateral.
