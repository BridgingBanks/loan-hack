#Legal Engineering: Old Discipline, New tools

Legal Engineers study an existing problem and create rule-based solutions. Yesterday our tools were paper and publishers and legislatures. Today our tools are codes and nodes and networks. 

At its simplest, legal engineering is a methodical, multidisciplinary process:

What: Existent business problem;

Why: Systemic and legal dynamics;

What if: We change something;

How-to: Tools to effect the desired change;

Can-do: Inspiration + Perspiration;

Test: Deploy something nondestructive;

Evaluate: What happened;

Revise: Based on results;

Retest: Repeat.
